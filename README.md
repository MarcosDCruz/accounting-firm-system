This project highlights an object-oriented design approach, emphasizing structured, maintainable, and scalable code. It efficiently manages customer, CPA, and assistant data through the use of classes and instance methods, enabling seamless creation, updating, and maintenance of profiles. The application incorporates a modular architecture, where the main program interacts solely with the Models. These Models serve as intermediaries, managing communication between the program logic and the database in a controlled and organized manner. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability compared to the functional design used in my earlier project.

I implemented the application's functionalities and models using Python, leveraging the psycopg2 package to establish a connection with a PostgreSQL server. This allowed the program to execute embedded SQL queries effectively, ensuring robust data management.
